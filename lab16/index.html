    <p>It was a bit of a challenge to try to get fix an error which is described in the "problems" section. We didn't <i>really</i> fix it, we just found a workaround.</p>
    <h2>Problems:</h2>
    <p>We had a big problem trying to figure out why we got a CORS error.

That's what we went with for now.</a></p>
