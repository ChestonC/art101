    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>A challenge we were going through was understanding how to create the
      function for this lab.</p>
    <h2>Problems:</h2>
    <p>A problem we faced was figuring out how to make the JavaScript code
      output what was typed into the text box. After a while, Brian did some
      testing on the console to figure it out and got it to work.</p>
    <h2>Results:</h2>
    <p>The results show up below when you input a word into the text box and click Submit.</p>
