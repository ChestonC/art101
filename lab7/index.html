    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>A challenge we faced was trying to figure out how to get the function in our JavaScript.
      We were kind of over-complicating the code and it ended up being pretty simple after thinking about it step-by-step.</p>
    <h2>Problems:</h2>
    <p>A problem we had was when the text is sorted and outputted, capital letters
       would take priority and end up being first in the output when they shouldn't have.
       We were able to overcome this by looking up the .toLowerCase() function which fixed the issue.</p>
