    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>There were some difficulties with getting the buttons to work properly since the type of
    button needs to be added, as well as some other stuff with getting js files and html files to work.</p>
    <h2>Problems:</h2>
    <p>There were a few issues with some linking and buttons activating as soon as the page loaded, but this was an issue we ran into
    a couple of labs ago, so looking at what we did for that lab really helped.</p>
    <h2>Results:</h2>
    <p>The results are here! Fill out the form, click the button, and see which house you're a part of: </p>
