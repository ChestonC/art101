    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>We had almost all labs basically functional so we thought there wouldn't
      be any labs we would have to revisit for this lab. It turned out that lab 13 wasn't working as intended.</p>
    <h2>Problems:</h2>
    <p>The problem with lab 13 was that it was missing a ">" after the jQuery
      link and after adding it, the site worked as intended.</p>
    <h2>Results:</h2>
    <p>The reults are in the debugging section.</p>
    <h2>Debugging:</h2>
    <p>For Lab 13, the JavaScript file was not being connected to the html file.
       After looking at the code closer, it turned out that we were missing a ">"
       after the link in the jQuery script tag. We fixed it by adding it in and the program worked.</p>
